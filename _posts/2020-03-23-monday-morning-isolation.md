title: Monday morning isolation
---

It almost feels impossible in the current climate to ignore the news, ignore all thoughts and talk about anything other the current pandemic that has spread around the wall. Hopefully with a new habit of meditation and a new vigor of motivation for working on my goals I can strive to do just that.

Being a software engineer and being connected to the internet while I'm working, has always made me a massive procrastinator, and in these times it feels even easier to dive into the news and to youtube and to talk to friends for hours about how bad things are. But it's exactly this that has made me realise something that I always used to say (picked up from Tim Ferriss I believe), I have no effect on the news, and it has very little effect on me. 

Sure, the world seems like it's ending, but by me knowing the latest death toll, or the new measures that country X has put into place, I'm not gaining anything into my life except stress. I must concentrate on the one thing that I can control, the output of my work.
