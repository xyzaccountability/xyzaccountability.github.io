title: Ready, steady, go!

Six weeks ago, I confronted my girlfriend of 7 years, and told her I knew she had been cheating on me. 

I could write so much about how I feel about this, but maybe I will leave that for another day.

I see two paths in my future, I either let this hang over me and become misserable and decline in to self pity. Or I use this as fuel and propel myself in to the future better than ever. That's what I want.

# About me
I'm 37, am moderately successful, but have always beaten myself up that I haven't done more. I just about get my job done, but never put in the extra effort, and I always leave things to the last minute, both in work and in my personal life. I'm going to change this.

I've been reading a lot about adult ADHD recently, and I really think it could explain everything, but I don't want that to become an excuse. I must learn to push myself and have the discipline that was never drilled into me as a child. My parent let me get away with anything growing up. I may well have ADHD, but I know for sure if they had disciplined me more and held me accountable I would be better today.

I'm not the most social person, not very confident with public speaking. Each year around my birthday I get very depressed, I'm not sure if it's just the time of year or if I am just very upset that another year has passed and I didn't do the things that I really wanted to do.

I want to become the best person possible.

I'm hoping to find an accountability partner or mastermind group to push each other forward in our goals. But until I do, this blog will be my accountabilty partner.
