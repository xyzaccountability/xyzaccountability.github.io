title: Lockdown blues
---

I've never truely appreciated the damage that cheating could do to somebody. I think I would say to someone the same thing that most guys would probably say "Dump them, NEXT!". But here I am, apparently with a choice, she's telling me that it was a mistake, that she really loves me. I don't know what to do with that. How do you trust that person again, how do you trust anyone again?

They say that time heals all wounds, and I couldn't have believed that 2 months ago, but today.. it feels easier, I still think about it sometimes, and this lockdown is making it very hard as I'm now completely cut off from all human contact. But spending time working on myself, lifting weights, running all REALLY help. 2 months have flown by in retrospect, it doessn't seem like it at the time, but it feels like it has now. Maybe my brain has deleted all those days that dragged on and I was miserable and crying.

I realised today that if we hadn't lost the baby last April, right now would be the best time of my life, despite the epidemic happening around the world. We would be together, with our new baby, she would be on maternity, I would be working from home. I would be so happy. But that's how life works sometimes I guess, I should be stronger coming out of this. Hopefully will have learnt some lessons.

I truely believed that she was the **one**, and in my heart I still think that is true. I don't know if I love her anymore, but I don't know how it's possible to find someone who is such a good match for me. I'm trying to write a list of all the flaws she has, and all the things that I would want in a future partner. But I never cared about any of that, I just cared about her.

Anyway,

Today I'm going to:

[ ] Lift weights - Back/Biceps
