title: One step backwards
---

I thought I was doing so well. I was fairly sure I knew what I wanted to do and was trying to put a plan in place to do that...Basically...get on with my life.

But then she came back yesterday to pack a suitcase with more clothes and stuff. It was heart wrenching watching her pack. I think what hurt the most was that... I could tell that SHE had decided it was over, from the way she was acting, and the what she said. So, I asked to talk to her, and I was in pieces.. but she was cool as a cucumber. I guess that she had truely moved on. It was only 2 weeks before that she was telling me that she would do what ever it takes to make it work and that she loved me. 

We ended up having a talk, and both realised that we were both shut off with each over for quite sometime. She said she didn't know that she felt like this, but I guess she must have right? She chose to cheat on me.

I said I missed her, she asked me "do you miss me, or miss what we used to have?". That's pretty deep, when I think back to how we were at the beginning, how we were for the first few years, it was unbelievable, we would spend hours looking into each others eyes, and just talking random things and having sex. But that stopped at somepoint, and our relationship turned into a normal relationship. There wasn't the passion anymore. I'm trying to remember when that happened, I guess it just diminished slowly, and every so often it would have been there again.. I never really noticed, I still loved her more than anything. 

I think our communication through all of it was the big issue, I can see so many times that I would withdraw and just zone out, I don't even know why really. I would get upset and then just completely withdraw into my own world, I couldn't even tell you why I was upset either. 

There's no excuse for cheating, and in my head I thought we had the perfect relationship and I was really great to her. But, despite giving her all the things...I think it's probably clear, that I stopped paying attention to her as much as I used to, stopped telling her how beautiful she was, how sexy I thought she was. And I guess that is what drove her to cheat on me. A good person would have told me that we had issues, and we could have worked on them together, as she wasn't perfect through this either. But I think she is just that kind of person that needs the attention, and NEEDS someone to be obsessed with her.. I think I probably wasn't that person for a long time.. I was too wrapped up in worrying about work and not being successful. But really, I am successful, If I would have told myself 10 years ago that I would be in this position financially and career wise I would be impressed. But I just don't give myself the credit to enjoy it all. And I really think that rubbed off on her. But she should have seen that and said that we're not connecting as much, and we could have worked on it...for the memory of what we had it would have been worth it to work on it. But she took the easy route I guess.

I need to remember this for the future. Put the phone away when I'm with a partner, tell them how beautiful they are and sexy. Organise date nights, not just dinner out...but dancing, club, sports, walks in the country followed by lunch.

Maybe it wasn't meant to be... It's so hard as I wanted children with HER so badly... but hopefully I will get there with someone else, and look forward to that with them too. If I can get half the connection that I had with her with someone new, who won't cheat on me.. that will be really great.
