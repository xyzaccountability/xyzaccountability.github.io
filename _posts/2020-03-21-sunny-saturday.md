title: Sunny Saturday
---

I always find it hard on the weekend to be motivated to be productive. I still have my goals, but it's the weekend right? I should be chillin.

If I'm going to be really successful in my self improvement journey, I need to hit my goals every day, including the weekends.

Today:
[X] Meditated for 20 minutes
[X] Weight lifting - Deadlifts
[X] Running - 6km in 40minutes
